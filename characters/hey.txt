If you are reading this, here's some things to know.
A character's icons is in the same folder as the spritesheet, xml, character.hx file, character.json file (optional), etc.
If should be set up like this:
character/
spritesheet.png and .xml
icon
character.hx
character.json (if done normally)

"treycharsicons.psd" is the name of the file I used to make some of the icons for the characters in the VS Trey port who didn't have any (the only one with an icon was normal trey)
